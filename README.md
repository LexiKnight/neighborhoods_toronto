# Neighborhood Demographic Analysis in Toronto

## Overview

This project aims to explore the demographic disparities between two neighborhoods in Toronto: Rosedale-Moore Park and Downtown Yonge East. Through an in-depth analysis of visible minority populations, income levels, educational attainment, and knowledge of official languages, this study highlights the socio-economic inequalities that persist within urban environments. By utilizing a combination of statistical analysis and data visualization, the research reveals significant differences in community dynamics and access to resources, underscoring the impact of systemic inequalities on social mobility and opportunities.

## Conclusion
This project contributes to a deeper understanding of residential segregation and socio-economic disparities in Toronto, emphasizing the importance of addressing systemic inequalities to foster community cohesion and improve access to opportunities for all residents.
